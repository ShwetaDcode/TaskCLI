# TaskCLI

C++ developed Command Line Interface (CLI) task management application. The application allows a user to add, view, complete and delete tasks. The task list is stored in a file (`tasks.txt`) and the tasks have a priority based on priority. The project illustrates the use of modular programming techniques by separating functionality into classes and files so that can be easily maintained and upgraded

## Features
- Add a new task with a description and priority.
- View all tasks with their priority and completion status.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Persistent task storage in a text file (`tasks.txt`).
